from Avocado

select *
from AvocadoCopy

select *
from Avocado
where Date is NULL or AveragePrice is NULL or Total_Volume is NULL 
-- None of the rows have missing information

-- Check data types in each column

select column_name, data_type
from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
where TABLE_NAME = 'Avocado'

--Data types are correct


-- 3. Find and remove duplicates

--Check for duplicates

select Date, AveragePrice, Total_Volume, type, year, region, Count(*)
from Avocado
group by Date, AveragePrice, Total_Volume, type, year, region
having Count(*) > 1

--2 duplicates reported

-- List the rows contaning duplicates to confirm that all columns are really identical

select *
from Avocado a
join (select Date, AveragePrice, Total_Volume  
from Avocado
group by Date, AveragePrice, Total_Volume 
having Count(*) > 1 )  b
on a.Date = b.Date
and a.AveragePrice = b.AveragePrice
and a.Total_Volume = b.Total_Volume

-- Remove these duplicates

with RowNumCTE as (
select *, 
row_number() over (
partition by Date, AveragePrice, Total_Volume, type, year, region
order by Date ) row_num
from Avocado)
delete
from RowNumCTE
where row_num > 1

-- Check 'regions' for completeness

select region, sum (Total_Volume) as TotalSalesPerRegion
from Avocado
group by region
order by TotalSalesPerRegion desc

-- This shows that there are also 'Total U.S.' and 'TotalUS' regions. 
--Because these are not distinct regions but ruther the sums of different regions, this data is not relevant and will be removed

delete from Avocado
where region = 'Total U.S.' or region = 'TotalUS'
